If you would like to become an instructor in The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme
please fill in this form in as much detail as you can. We will get back to you as
soon as possible to confirm your place on a course. We are really looking forward
to meeting you and welcoming you to the exciting and empowering world of The
Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme!

This course offers 'Life Time Access' and can be completed in your own time, as quickly
as twelve weeks or as long as it takes you. This applies if you are a reflexologist or
not a reflexologist.
The three-day, in person, course is open to everyone. In particular, you do not need to be a
qualified reflexologist, nor any other type of therapist, in order to do this course.
There is also a CPD-approved
[two-day, in person, course for qualified relexologists only](<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'reflexologists' %>).
Qualified reflexologists are also welcome to attend the last day of the
three-day non-reflexologist&apos;s course, which have identical
content and delivery, for the price of the two-day course. Please indicate on the booking
form if you wish to do this.

The fee for the course is £ for the two-day reflexologist&apos;s course.
This includes all your tuition and training materials, access to all our on-line
facilities and enough teaching materials to run at least one course earning £300 or more.
You will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit of £100 to
secure your place once we have confirmed that there is one available.

    </ul>
    You will be expected to give reflexology to, and receive it from, your fellow students during this course.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to qualify you will be required to:
    <ul>
        <li>Complete the course to the satisfaction of your tutor.</li>
        <li>Participate in a micro-teach exercise with your peers during the course, including a self-assessment and a peer assesment.</li>

Note that in order to remain an instructor you will be required to purchase official course materials for each of your students and to abide by an appropriate code of ethics.
