Our courses for parents are typically presented as several weekly
group workshops attended by parents or carers and their children. In
addition to learning how to use simple <a href="<%= url_for('/page/reflexology') %>">reflexology</a> to help you and your child,
these workshops are a great meet-up and a useful way to extend your support
network.
The course
uses a collection of delightful rhymes, pictures and stories to
engage children and teach the simple reflexology.
The programme is delivered by
<a href="<%= url_for 'crp.instructors' %>">specially qualified instructors</a>
and is supported by high quality materials including the lovely book,
<a href="<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'books' %>">The Mouse's House</a>.
There is a special version of the course for
parents of children with <a href="<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'addneeds' %>#additional">additional needs</a>.

<strong>I am a parent and I have experienced first hand that feeling of utter
helplessness that hits us when our child is distressed or unwell with
conditions that we may not consider worthy of a trip to the GP.</strong> Of course it
still pains us to watch them suffer and this is very dis-empowering for us as
parents or carers and for our children too, who naturally turn to us for
answers and to take their pain and discomfort away.
</p>
<p>
The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme is a simple course of fun, interactive
sessions, spread over several weeks. It is taught by fully trained and insured
instructors. It empowers parents and carers to be able to offer their
children a non-invasive complementary therapy at home at any time of the day or
night, from someone they love and feel safe with. The course shows you how to
treat specific conditions of childhood and includes a series of handouts in the
form of mini booklets that can be used by a parent or carer. A carefully
designed series of rhymes, pictures and stories is used to engage the child and
to help you to learn and remember the reflexology.

<p>
All this empowers you to do something positive to help your child. It also
helps your child by strengthening the bond they already feel for you and
strengthening their belief in you. This gentle therapy offers families a
valuable relief from some of the worst feelings a parent can experience,
powerlessness and helplessness!
</p>
<p>
Reflexology is a powerful but gentle therapy which is particularly beneficial
with children and can be a great help in times of distress and with common
childhood illnesses such as constipation, teething, colic and so on.
Unfortunately it is not always practical to visit a reflexologist, especially
in the middle of the night! Also, a strange person in a strange place might not
be the most helpful thing in these situations, which are often very emotionally
charged, and might even be frightening for some children. Children who are
unwell, or just distressed or upset for some reason, want to stay close to the
people and places they know and love.
</p>
<p>
The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme
solves all these problems by making it possible for you to give reflexology
treatments yourself, whenever and wherever you want. You can start helping with
everything from tantrums to teething, giving you precious time to relax and
take a step back so you can decide what to do next – a visit to a
reflexologist, a trip to the doctor, some more of your own treatments or
perhaps even just a cuddle is all that will be needed.
</p>
<div class="horizontal-divider-small"></div>
<p>
The beauty of The
Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme is that these treatments can be given at any
time and in any place. Your child doesn&apos;t have to be ill to give them any of
the treatments. If your child suffers with constipation give them the treatment
for it every day – they cannot have too much reflexology! You can use the
treatments as a way of controlling the condition and keeping your child calm,
relaxed, happy and well.
</p>
<p>
The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme offers parents
and carers the opportunity to learn enough reflexology to treat their family
without having to spend thousands of pounds becoming qualified. It is a special
medicine cabinet for all your family that is completely non-invasive, that
no-one can overdose on, that will bring you all together with love and respect
through touch and bonding and most importantly empowers both parent/carer and
child. Win, win all round!
</p>
<p>
The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme is unique. It
has been specially created to engage children through the use of animals,
rhymes and story. It is a fun way of gathering together with friends, NCT
groups and other parents and carers and spending time together. All the parents
who have already attended a course have had positive results after their first
class. Reflexology is a powerful tool and The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme
makes it available to you, now.
