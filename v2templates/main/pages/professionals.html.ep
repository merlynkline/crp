<p>
Included in our wide range of <a href="<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'courses' %>">courses</a>
we have special courses which will teach you how to use simple
<a href="<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'reflexology' %>">reflexology</a> to support
your work with children in your setting and, if you wish, how to pass
that same knowledge on to the parents of the children in your care.
The main course is a one day course which is typically delivered in your setting
to enable some or all of the staff to use reflexology in the context of
The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme. There is also a further two day course
available if you would like to be able to pass on this knowledge to parents - this
is a subset of the main Instructor course. Alternatively you could
<a href="<%= url_for '/instructors' %>">become a fully qualified instructor</a>
and run parents courses in your setting or elsewhere.
