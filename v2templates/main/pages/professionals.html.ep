The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme is a powerful tool for
early years practitioners and we have courses and materials designed
specially to help you in your setting.

Using simple [reflexology](<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'reflexology' %>)
on the children in your care not only gives you an
effective action to take in times of stress but also improves bonding and offers
continuity of care with homes that may be using it themselves. The activity
fits well with developmental objectives as well as being positive play and
promoting wellbeing generally. Offering kids reflex as part of your service
can also be a great USP (unique selling point) for your setting. This is a
wonderful tool for early years pracitioners of every kind, such as **Day
Care** facilities, **Nannies** and **Maternity Nurses** and similar.

Our wide range of [courses](<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'courses' %>)
includes special training which will teach you how to use simple
[reflexology](<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'reflexology' %>) to support
your work with children in your setting.
The main course is a one day course which is typically delivered in your setting
to enable some or all of the staff to use reflexology in the context of
<img src="<%= url_for '/images/Photos/EYP1.jpg' %>" class="illo-large left" />
The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme. The course covers everything you need to learn and to make
effective use of very simple reflexology which has been carefully designed to engage
children using techniques such as stories, rhyme, colours and animal characters
which are all related directly to the reflexology process itself. High quality training
materials are included, as is access to further personalised material on our website which
supports your ongoing use of the programme and provides electronic verification of your
qualification.

<h2>Parent support centres</h2>

Our [courses](<%= url_for 'crp.page', page => 'courses' %>) also
include a special two day training course which enables staff at parent support
centres how to pass on this knowledge to parents and carers. This
is a subset of the main [instructors course](<%= url_for 'crp.instructors' %>).

This course was created in conjunction with **Sure Start** and
includes everything you need to enable you to get parents and carers started
using this wonderful programme, from teaching techniques through simple reflexology to
a complete and detailed teaching programme so you will be able to set up and run workshops
<img src="<%= url_for '/images/Photos/EYP4.jpg' %>" class="illo-large right" />
from beginning to end. The high quality materials include a comprehensive manual, a variety
of teaching materials and special handouts to pass on to the parents and carers. The course
includes plenty of hand-on pracitical work so you can be sure of confidence in passing
this knowledge on.
