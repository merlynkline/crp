I come from humble beginnings: my parents were poor, my mother was illiterate, my father was
uneducated but had a ferocious work ethic. I don&apos;t remember having many toys or books when
I was a child. I spent the greater part of the first ten years of my life outside in nature
digging treasure from river banks, catching newts in buckets from brooks, scrumping sour apples
from what I now know to be cider apple orchards, picking flowers, berries, mushrooms and anything
else that I liked the look of or thought might be edible, and crawling through ancient limestone
caves (that if my children went near I would probably have apoplexy! Health and Safety
just didn&apos;t exist in those days!).

My childhood was idyllic I remember it with great joy and real sense of freedom.
When I was eleven my world was shattered by my mother leaving home. A year later when I thought
things couldn&apos;t get worse my older sister was killed in a most violent and shocking way
that destroyed the remnants of the life I had known. My father, totally destroyed but trying
his hardest to manage his family, turned heavily to drink. Some of the
hardest years of my life followed and I left school as soon as I could without any
qualifications and then left home.

When I was nineteen I met Merlyn, my husband and general all round amazing website building genius.
It took me a long time to find complementary therapy but once I did I knew it was exactly where
I should be. Working with women was inevitable really after losing all the women in my life so
early. Supporting them when they were at their most vulnerable, during conception, pregnancy and
beyond with their children had great meaning for me.
I always felt it was important to do something that would make a difference to someone else&apos;s
life. It may be part of what is called survivor&apos;s guilt but it was important not to waste my life
when my sister&apos;s was taken from her.

The Children&apos;s Reflexology Programme is my great passion and was created to make a difference
in another person&apos;s life, to offer women choices where they may not have existed before through
support, friendship, community and the gentle healing power of reflexology and bonding touch.

I dedicate my work to my sister and my father.
