The Children's Reflexology Programme Instructor course has been specially created to empower mums, dads, grandparents and carers to run their own businesses teaching infant reflexology to other parents and carers. Written specifically to empower women with children who may find it difficult to go back to work or secure a job because they have a child as well as older women who may feel pushed aside once they reach a certain age, this offers you the chance to run your own business with a freedom to suit you.
</p>
If you would like to become a certified instructor yourself you can enroll in
the special training course which will qualify you to deliver The Children's
Reflexology Programme and provide you with all the materials you need to give
parents and carers the best possible experience. You will also gain access to
the members-only areas of this site which provides all sorts of supporting
material and helps you to advertise yourself and your courses when you're ready
to start.
