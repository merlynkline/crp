<h3>General advice</h3>
Reflexology is a gentle, relaxing, bonding activity. Never rush or force anything.
Do not practice if you feel stressed or tense. Always ensure that you feel
safe, secure and confident in what you are doing. Never do anything
that you are not comfortable with.
Reflexology is not a substitute for medical attention. If you have any concerns about
your child, please seek appropriate medical help.
<h3>Agreement</h3>
By signing up for this course you are agreeing to the following:
<ul>
    <li>You have read the general advice above and will follow it.</li>
    <li>You take full responsibility for yourself and your child, and for everything that
    happens to you and your child in relation to the course.</li>
    <li>If you have any doubts you will seek the advice of a medical professional
    before proceeding with classes.</li>
    <li>You will disclose any information regarding your own and your childâ€™s health
    relevant to the class.</li>
    <li>You will keep the course tutor informed of any health issues that arise
    during the course, for both you and your child.</li>
    <li>You will not attend any class if you or your child are ill or there are any
    signs of sickness in the family.</li>
    <li>Payment must be made at the time of booking.</li>
    <li>Places are subject to availability. In the unlikely event that we cannot find a
    suitable place we will refund the course fee in full.</li>
    <li>Refunds are not given once the course has started. Credits for future
    bookings may be given at our discretion.</li>
    <li>Cancellation by you must be made more than one week before the
    course starts or we will be unable to refund your money.</li>
    <li>Cancellation by us is unlikely but will entitle you to a full refund for
    any outstanding classes.</li>
    <li>We cannot provide refunds for missed classes but we may be able
    to find a place for you in the same class on another course.</li>
    <li>Safety is always our first concern but we will not be liable for any
