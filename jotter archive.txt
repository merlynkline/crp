+ Add new Instructor Trainer qualifications
    + Instructor training courses section needs to be accessible to users with an appropriate qualification
        ~ DB updates:
            ~ Add qualification records
                ~ Instructor trainer
                ~ AN Instructor trainer
            ~ Add column: course_type.qualification_earned_id (NULL means it's a parents course, otherwise it'a an instructors course)
            ~ Add course_type rows for instructor training courses, earning the relevant qualifications
                ~ Instructor
                ~ AN Instructor
                ~ Reflexologist Instructor
                X AN Reflexologist Instructor
            ~ Add column: instructors_course.course_type_id
            ~ Add column: instructors_course.duration TEXT
            ~ UPDATE instructors_course SET course_type_id = SELECT id FROM course_type WHERE qualification_earned_id = instructors_course.qualification_id
            ~ UPDATE instructors_course SET duration = '3 days'
            ~ DROP instructors_course.qualification_id
            ~ DROP profile.instructor_trainer
        + Code and template changes:
            ~ Make a custom accessor for instructors_course.qualification_id so attempts to use it throw an exception
            ~ Replace refs to instructors_course.qualification_id with course_type.qualification_earned_id
            ~ Wherever we fetch parent course information we must restrict to those WHERE course_type.qualification_earned_id IS NULL
            ~ Wherever we fetch instructor course information we must restrict to those WHERE course_type.qualification_earned_id IS NOT NULL
            ~ Instructors get to see the "Instructor training courses" link if they have qualifications matching any course_type.qualification_required_id where course_type.qualification_earned_id IS NOT NULL
            ~ When adding/editing Instructor training courses:
                - templates/trainers/course.html.ep
                ~ Replace qualification drop-down is replaced by an appropriately restricted course_type selection
                ~ Add field for instructors_course.duration
                ~ Ensure instructors_course.instructor_id is set correctly
            ~ When showing details of Instructor training courses, include:
                ~ course_type.description
                ~ course_type.qualification_earned_id
                ~ instructors_course.duration
                ~ instructors_course.instructor_id
                ~ Link to the instructor's personal web page
            ~ Brief course details (e.g. when confirming a delete) could show more
            ~ Show details of Instructor training courses on personal web pages of Instructor trainers
            ~ Admin pages
                ~ Stats collection for homepage needs to count courses properly and add instructor trainer courses
                ~ Course Summary box for account record page needs to include Instructor training courses and links to lists of them
                    ~ List of Instructor training courses for instructor needs to be added
                ~ NB: Bug: In dev, course summary for SQ says "Past: None" but links to a non-empty list
            ~ Member pages:
                ~ _available_course_types() needs to be restricted to parents or instructors courses
            ~ Booking form for instructor training courses
                ~ Identify by course ID and look up details
                ~ Remove the old booking form
                ~ Change the book button so it links by id (templates/parts/instructors_course_list.html.ep and templates/member_site/welcome.html.ep)
                ~ Send email to the trainer as well as to SQ (try not to duplicate to SQ! Perhaps both email addrs on one email would do that)
            + Add instructor course PDFS
                ~ Add mechanism for showing course PDFs for instructor courses, like parent courses
                ~ Posters are currently named for qualification code - need renaming for course_type.code (or something) and move to common course docs
                ~ Add posters to templates/trainers/course_docs.html.ep
                ~ Change current instructor course Poster buttons to use new code and location
                + Add bits to poster PDFs
                    ~ Instructor personalisation
                    ~ Start date and duration
                    ? Qualification earned?
                    ? Course type?
                ~ Add button for course PDFs to admin instructor course lists
                + Add other PDFs
                    - list in templates/trainers/course_docs.html.ep
