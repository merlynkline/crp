+ Premium content space for e-courses etc
    ~ URLs like /premium/*dir/*id/....
    - id is a wordnum that gets a unique ID in an auth table
    ~ content is in premium/templates/dir
    ~ static content from premium/static/dir
    ~ auth table:
        ~ id (PK)
        ~ create date
        ~ dir
        ~ owner email (indexed)
        ~ owner name
        ~ disabled flag
    - authorisation is by an auth cookie or by lookup in the auth table to generate the cookie
    ~ auth cookie is a long-lived cookie with the path set to /premium/*dir that has the id, dir, name, email and expiry date (about a week), encrypted in it
        - eg: $c->signed_cookie(premium => "prem stuff", {httponly => 1, path => '/instructor'});
        ~ pseudo-code for auth process:
            - if(cookie present and (id == cookie id or id == "_authorised")) {
            -     decrypt cookie;
            -     if(*dir == cookie dir) {
            -         if(cookie expired) {
            -             generate cookie for cookie id or redirect to access page and exit;
            -         }
            -     }
            -     else {
            -         redirect to access page and exit;
            -     }
            - }
            - else {
            -     check dir exists or premium 404;
            -     generate cookie for *id or redirect to access page and exit;
            - }
            - if(*id != "_authorised") {
            -     redirect to /premium/:dir/_authorised/sub-path;
            -     exit;
            - }
            - display page or premium 404;
        - This auth process is designed such that:
            - Most authorisation is by cookie, so it's quick
            - New cookies are generated reasonably often so lockouts etc are effective
            - Most access is through a URL that doesn't include the ID so sharing it won't work
    ~ should do the normal kidsreflex cookie notification
    ~ Need a means to deliver premium content other than pages (images, video, etc)
        ~ static content in premium/static/:dir with URL /premium/:dir/:id/static/*path
        ~ streaming content in premium/stream/:dir with URL /premium/:dir/:id/stream/*path
        ~ How to handle streaming content?
    ~ access pages have some common content:
        ~ allow entry of an email address to get an email containing links to all authed premium content for that email
        ~ some means of complaining if you think you should have access
    - access page template is templates/premium/dir/access.html.ep
    ~ Each newly created auth cookie is logged in the cookie log table:
        ~ id (PK)
        ~ auth_id -> auth table (indexed)
        ~ timestamp
        ~ remote IP

            ~ Pick dir from drop-down and enter email address, name
                ~ Drop down is generated by examining directories and checking for welcome.html.ep and access.html.ep
            ~ Don't allow duplicates (dir+email)
            ~ Send an email with the new authed link to the owner

X Is there a memory leak somewhere? PDF rendering?
    - There does seem to be - we occasionally get failures because there's not enough memory to fork a child process
    - Removing the etag handler doesn't seem to help
    - Apparent association with fetching PDFs seems to be just because they are large content. Happens with other things but less obviously. Process grows by amount related to size of fetched document.
    - Looks like this happens in Morbo as well as Hypnotoad
    - Possibly this is just normal memory consumption. Limting the number of connections before restarting has helped anyway.

+ Some method of finding unsatisfied enquiries to decide where to put courses on etc.

+ Refactoring
    + Move duplicate code from the instructor and ordinary course models into a common module
    + CRP::Controller::Members::_display_course_editor_with() should load the course into $c->param rather than passing the course_record to the template
    + CRP::Controller::Trainers::_display_course_editor_with() should load the course into $c->param rather than passing the course_record to the template
    + Move business logic off shop template and into code

+ The instructor's 'search for enquiries' page should start with location rather than postcode
+ Should the postcode in the profile be mandatory?
+ Pass some images through tinyjpg/tinypng

+ Certificate management
    + Database table with: certificate_id, instructor_id, issue_date, life_time, type, version, issuer_id, instructors_name, revocation_date, revoker_id
        - Type is for course certificates and renewal certificates (and maybe others at some point)
        - Version is so we can have different PDFs over time and reprints will still use the originals
        - issuer_id is for the trainer that issued the certificate and is duplicated for automatic renewal. NULL means Sue!
        - instructors_name is recorded in case it changes after issue, so the original certificate can be reproduced
    + When an instructor qualifies or they qualify for certificate renewal, add a row to the certificate table.
    + Facility to produce a PDF of the certificate with an electronic signature encoding the certificate_id, including a QRcode, with or without scan of issuer's manual signature
    + Development system marks certificate as sample
    ~ Certificates can be checked easily by going to a URL that includes the certificate's electronic signature
        ~ Page shows certificate details (or message saying it's not valid)
        ~ Link to instructor's personal page
    + Instructors can easily get a PDF copy of their most recent renewal certificate by a link in their control panel
    + Administrators can create and revoke certificates
    + Administrators can get PDFs of certificates without the scanned issuer's manual signature, for the issuer to actually sign

 Workflow notes
 --------------
 - DB changes:
    + Modify lib/CRP/Model/Schema/Result/*
    + Update version number in lib/CRP/Model/Schema.pm
    + check status - run: ./script/crp migrate status
    + run: ./script/crp migrate prepare
    + check new autosql files like: share/deploy/migrations/PostgreSQL/upgrade/1-2/001-auto.sql
    + if any tweaks are needed:
